# What is A25Lab.com?

A25Lab.com is the place where all mini projects, tools, services or full blown startups 
developed and supported by [Around25](https://around25.com) are first launched as experiments
or as first public access in order to get feedback and constantly improve them.

## Research

We encourage our developers to experiment 
and constantly learn and improve their skills. A result of this is doing a lot 
of research in various technologies, ideas and products. These are documented
and available here.

## Development

Some of these _experiments_ are built into products and services that you can find
on this playground. You can use these services for free with certain limits or you
can sign up for the service and use them without any restrictions.
