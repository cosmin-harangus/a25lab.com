# ICO Manager

So you want to start your own crypto project and use an ERC20 token as a utility token inside your project as well as a distribution mechanism in order to raise funds for your ICO. 

All well and good, but you've never done an ICO before. 

Doing a bit of research you find that you need to ensure a great deal of transparency and security in order to have a credible and successful ICO.

Here are some of the things you need to be aware of:

- You should use best practices and existing open source code in writing your contract
- Your potential investors will want to know that the smart contract you wrote for your ERC20 token is transparent and well written
- Team members and Private Investors should have their tokens locked up for a certain period
- You should distribute the tokens to all participants in the same day if possible

Building this on your own requires a lot of research and careful implementation and a lot of testing, which takes a time that could be used to promote your product. That's why we've created the [ICO Manager](https://icomanager.a25lab.com).

The ICO Manager allows you to easily create, deploy and edit ERC20 tokens and 
then manage the distribution of tokens during and after your ICO.
