# ICO Manager

So you want to start your own crypto project and use an ERC20 token as a utility token inside your project as well as a distribution mechanism in order to raise funds for your ICO. 

All well and good, but you've never done an ICO before. 

Doing a bit of research you find that you need to ensure a great deal of transparency and security in order to have a credible and successful ICO.

Here are some of the things you need to be aware of:

- You should use best practices and existing open source code in writing your contract
- Your potential investors will want to know that the smart contract you wrote for your ERC20 token is transparent and well written
- Team members and Private Investors should have their tokens locked up for a certain period
- You should distribute the tokens to all participants in the same day if possible

Building this on your own requires a lot of research and careful implementation and a lot of testing, which takes a lot of time that could be used to promote/build your product. That's why we've created the [ICO Manager](https://icomanager.a25lab.com).

## Why ICO Manager

The ICO Manager allows you to easily create, deploy and edit ERC20 tokens and 
then manage the distribution of tokens during and after your ICO.

It does so by using the latest open source code and best practices to build and deploy your contract. It also keeps your private keys safe by ensuring that they never leave your hardware wallet and that you don't need to use them in an insecure environment.

You can use it to create an ERC20 token directly from the browser or import an already existing contract as long as it adheres to the ERC20 standard. All contracts generated are verified with [Etherscan.io](https://etherscan.io/) to ensure transparency and be able to load information about the generated contract application binary interface (ABI) needed to perform some actions on the contract.

Distributing tokens to your team is easy and verifiable through the use of lock contracts that allow you to securely store funds for any period of time and only unlock them once that period has passed.
