# Matching Engine

We LOVE challenges!! The more interesting the better.

A while back a new lead of ours wanted to build a matching engine for their new exchange and they were looking for a partner to implement it. They found us through a friend and we entertained the idea, without having built one before simply because, like I mentioned above, WE LOVE CHALLENGES.

We set to do our research and used Go as the programming language of choice, because we've used it in the past with good results and we wanted to dive deeper into it.

The challenge was not just to build a matching engine, but to build one that can reach over 1,000,000 trades per second.

In the end we've lost the lead, but the challenge still remained and being very curious by definition we've started doing our own research into what it means to build a matching engine, what orders and trades are, what existing solutions are already on the market or open source, what is a market order, etc.
