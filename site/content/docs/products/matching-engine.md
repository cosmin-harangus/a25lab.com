# Matching Engine

A while back we wrote and article on our blog describing how you could build a 
high performance matching engine in Go that could handle over 1 milion transactions
per second.

We've successfully completed that milestone and since then we've used it as the default
matching engine for a number of clients that use it in their own crypto exchanges.
