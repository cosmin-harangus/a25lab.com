# Hashiru.Exchange

Building an exchange from scratch is hard; very hard. From choosing the right technologies, 
ensuring security and scalability, to daily maintenance and operations.

The Hashiru.Exchange platform allows you to quickly deploy a high performance white label
exchange in a matter of minutes, while ensuring the highest level of security and compliance.

The system is tested and audited regularly by qualified professionals and third party entities 
and has been battle tested already in a number of exchanges.

## Motivation

A while back we were launched with a challenge (we love challenges) by one potential client. He was looking to build a trading engine that can handle 1 million transactions per second. According to him this could only be done in Java or C++ and that if we don't know these languages he will not work with us. We didn't, or at least not at a level above what we did in college.
